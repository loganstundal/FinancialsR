# sample_sic

# Function returns a sample of stock symbols for companies in the same
# industry sector for comparison purposes.

# These symbols can be used with financials() to builds a cross-sectional
# list of companies for comparison purposes.


# See here for more:
# https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/siccodes.htm

# Might not be possible because I would need a cross-referenced list with sic AND cik codes or stock symbols.
